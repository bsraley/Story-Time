I just had a schnapsidee about what we could do at the beach!
We could drive over to it in a BMW and stay at a nearby hotel.
I heard they have great Bratwurst.
After eating we can take a trip to the Biergarten.
I think it's just above the Ratskeller down the street.
Everyone in town knows about the Ratskeller on this street it is where Rammstein played their first ever show.
The musik was so loud that it scared this old man right out of his lederhosen!
Their number one hit single Luftschloss was nominated for an emmy last year.
